# Data Transformation

This repository contains various data extraction, transformation processing and visualization tools. Currently it contains the following:

  * [`data.Table`](#tables) provides you with a way to ingest, transform and process data tables in comma-separated value format and output in CSV, ASCII and SQL formats;
  * [`data.DOM`](#dom) provides a document object model which can read and write the XML format in addition to validating
  the XML;
  * [`data.Canvas`](#canvas) provides a drawing canvas on which graphics primitives such as lines, circles, text and rectangles can be placed. Additionally transformation, grouping and stylizing of primitives can be applied. Canvases can currently be written in SVG format, the intention is to also allow rendering using OpenGL later.
